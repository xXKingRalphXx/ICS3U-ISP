# ICS3U ISP
An ASCII game of checkers (with the full standard rules). This was my own idea for an Independent Study Project (ISP) for an ICS 3U course.

`ICS3U_FP_Final_Submission_Damilola.java` is the file I submitted to my instructor for evaluation. It contains an implementation of checkers.

Note that a sample of the game's output can be found in `EXAMPLE RUN.txt` or any file of the form `TST session output - *`.
